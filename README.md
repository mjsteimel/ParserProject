# ParserProject

## Team Members:
Matthew Steimel

## Project Description:
This is a simple Python parser created with ANTLR. It supports arithmetic operators, assignment operators, if/elif/else blocks, conditional statements, while and for loops, nested structures, and comments. The program takes a python file as a command line argument, then attempts to parse it, outputting whether or not the parsing succeeded, as well as generating a parse tree in a text file.

## Requirements:
Python 3
ANTLR Runtime for Python 3

## How to use:
Run the program from the command line, passing the name of a Python file as a command line argument.
Example: python parser.py example.py
